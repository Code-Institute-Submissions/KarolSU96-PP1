## Description

My personal Site is a simple website build to introduce me to people that visit it and to give them the highligh of my hobbies.
It allows the musicians that I meet to quickly look at my interest and contact me if they are willing to.

The website consists of multiple pages:

The header and footer style stays the same throughout all 4 pages.The whole website is using Nunito font.

On "About me" page user the visitors can see how I look and read a short bio that describes what I do with small encouragement for jam session.
