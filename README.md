## Validator testing:

- W3C validator shows no errors or warnings.
- Jigsaw validator shows no errors or warnings.
- Lighthouse score is very high. The site gets a few points off because of navbar anchor tags. These anchor tags are taking the users to different pages on my webpage, therefore I decided that adding "rel" attribute is not needed.

## Improvement:

There is still a bit of improvement to be done.
When I learn about the back end I want to actually be able to read the messages that the visitors to my page will send me and cooperate with them. For now the form is just there but I hope to be able to correct this project in near future and use it as my virtual business card during music events that I will attend.
